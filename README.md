Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Project Overview
### Backgroud and Purpose
Louise is an up and coming playwright with a new play named "fever". Presently Louise is looking for a way to fund this play by starting a crowd funding campaign
She has an estimated budget in mind, but she is hesitant about jumping both feet first into the sea of crowd funding without informed knowledge of how successful, or not, past crowd funding campaigns have been, particularly for plays.
